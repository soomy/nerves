The developed method can segment the sciatic nerve with human-level performance regarding quantitative evaluation metrics. As we aim to leverage the diagnosis and the assessment of all peripheral nerves, obviously future work should go in the direction of a method which can segment all peripheral nerves. Although not used in this work, we have further \gls{mrn} images available from different anatomical regions (upper \& lower arm, lower leg) for the volunteer cohort. A method could be developed also incorporating these \gls{mrn} images. However, given that the sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the human body, segmenting smaller peripheral nerves might be difficult. Almost certainly a large number of \gls{mrn} images with higher resolution would be required to achieve an acceptable level of segmentation performance.\\
Regarding technical developments, Another point could be to reduce the axial spacing during the \gls{mrn} acquisition and reinvestigate the potential segmentation performance increase of \gls{3d} context.\\
