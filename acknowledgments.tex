\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
   
I would first like to thank my supervisors Fabian Balsiger and Alain Jungo. Their support throughout the whole thesis was invaluable. Whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question, they had time for me. Seriously, thank you!

Secondly, I would like to thank my first examiner Mauricio Reyes. Discussions with him were always interesting, and he provided helpful feedback and comments during my thesis.

Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude towards my second examiner Olivier Scheidegger. He gave me valuable insights into his work as a physician, and I very much enjoyed the visits at the Inselspital.

I would also like to thank the members of the MIA group at the ISTB. Times with you were always fun, and it was interesting to hear about your ongoing projects during the meetings.

Finally, I would like to thank the colleagues from the ISTB. I enjoyed the events and the familiar atmosphere at the institute.
